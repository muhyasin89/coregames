    ---        OVERVIEW        ---
    ------------------------------

    The Stores system allows users to purchase and sell Items, Currencies & Upgrades.

    You can use the Database to define Purchasables and Sellables, then hook them into Stores.

    There are included templates that make it easy to set up an interactive in-world shops
    and the UI needed to drive these sales.

    If you have any questions or feedback please feel free to let us know!

    ------------------------------
    ---          SETUP         ---
    ------------------------------

    Stores, Purchasables & Sellables are created by adding data to the Database. Like other systems,
    this can be done with either Data Tables or Hierarchy objects.

    Example Data Tables are available for you to fill out, found in the "My Tables" section of Project Content:
        - Stores
        - Purchaseables
        - Sellables

    If you're creating data with the Hierarchy approach, the object structure for stores is as follows:
        Stores (the DataGroup)
        |__ Store1
        |__ Store2
        |__ ...

        Purchaseables (the DataGroup)
        |__ Purchaseable1
            |__ Inputs
                |__ Input1
                |__ Input2
                |__ ...
            |__ Drops
                |__ Drop1
                |__ Drop2
                |__ ...

        Sellables (the DataGroup)
        |__ Sellable1
            |__ Inputs
                |__ Input1
                |__ Input2
                |__ ...
            |__ Drops
                |__ Drop1
                |__ Drop2
                |__ ...

    ------------------------------
    ---       STORE ZONES      ---
    ------------------------------

    Stores can be added to the world using Store Catalog Zones.
    A basic template is available for this purpose: "Store Catalog Zone - Look (Database)"
    The StoreId custom property on the root of this template will link it to your Store data.

    Individual Purchasables can also be made available in the world.
    A "Purchaseable Item Zone - Look (Database)" template can be used for this purpose.

    These zones are supported by pre-placing them in the scene or loading them through an Area Object Loader.
