    When building a game, you will often need to give yourself items or currency for testing
    purposes. For some things, you may want to do something like create a duplicate starting
    items table that you can just swap out when you want to test. But for others, you will
    need to just give youself things while actually playing the game.
    
    We have given you a series of commands that can be used for that purpose. For full details
    on valid commands, check out the "Currency README" and the "Inventory README". But if you
    just need to give youself something quick, try the commands below:
    
    
    /inv add item="Carrot Seed" amount=10
    
  	/cur add cur=coins amount=10000
    
    
    
    *This only works if you are a bot, or on the admin list!
